Create a static QR code people can use to withdraw funds from a Lightning Network wallet

LNURL is a range of lightning-network standards that allow us to use lightning-network differently. An LNURL withdraw is the permission for someone to pull a certain amount of funds from a lightning wallet.

The most common use case for an LNURL withdraw is a faucet, although it is a very powerful technology, with much further reaching implications. For example, an LNURL withdraw could be minted to pay for a subscription service. Or you can have a LNURLw as an offline Lightning wallet (a pre paid "card"), you use to pay for something without having to even reach your smartphone.

LNURL withdraw is a very powerful tool and should not have his use limited to just faucet applications. With LNURL withdraw, you have the ability to give someone the right to spend a range, once or multiple times. This functionality has not existed in money before.
